Atividade 01

Analyzing Data with Hive

    Write a Hive query for each of the tasks below. Save the queries in a single text file named Task10.hive:
        Compute the average arrdelay of flights landing in Denver (dest equals "DEN")
        Compute the average arrdelay of flights where the origin is LAX and the dest is SFO
        Determine which dest airport had the highest average arrdelay


Atividade 02

Define and Populate an ORCFile Table

    Define a Hive table named sfo_weather that satisfies all of the following criteria:
        A Hive-managed table
        The data is stored in the ORCFile format
        The table is populated with the records in the datasets/flightdelays/sfo_weather.csv file on the client machine.
        The schema matches the columns in sfo_weather.csv - 
          the first column is a string named station_name, 
          followed by integers for the Year, Month, DayOfMonth, precipitation, temperature_max, and temperature_min

Atividade 03

Hive Join

    Write a Hive query in a file named atividade03.hive that satisfies the following criteria:
        Use Tez as the execution engine
        The result of the query is in a new Hive-managed table named flights_weather stored as a textfile
        Join the flightdelays table with the sfo_weather table where dest or origin equals "SFO" in flightdelays, 
        and the year, month and dayofmonth are equal in the two tables
        Select all columns from the flightdelays table, and the temperature_max and temperature_min columns from sfo_weather

Atividade 04

Hive Partitioned Tables

    Write a Hive query in a file named atividade04.hive that satisfies the following criteria:
        Define a new Hive-managed table named weather_partitioned that has the same schema as the sfo_weather table
        The table is partitioned on the year and month columns
        The data is stored in the ORCFile format
        Insert the records from January, 2008, of the sfo_weather table into the appropriate partition of weather_partitioned
